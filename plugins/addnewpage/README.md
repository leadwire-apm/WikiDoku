## Credits

The plugin was originally written by [Benjamin Santalucia](https://github.com/ben8p) (aka iDo) in 2006. It was forked after the 2009-02-14 release of Dokuwiki, and moved to GitHub by [Robert McLeod](https://github.com/hamstar) in 2012. 
Refer to the [Legacy Releases section](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:addnewpage#legacy_releases) in the plugin's home page for details on what happened in those early, pre-GitHub years.

In 2013, [Sam Wilson](https://github.com/samwilson) picked up the plugin's maintenance and actively supported it until he stopped using DokuWiki at the end of 2016. 
During this time, he merged several improvements and fixes contributed by these fine people:

- [Michael Braun](https://github.com/michael-dev)
- [RÃ³bert Toth](https://github.com/FurloSK)
- [Gerrit Uitslag](https://github.com/klap-in) added support for newpagetemplate plugin in 2014
- [Albert Chern](https://github.com/achern), disabling of restricted parent namespaces in 2015

In May 2023, [Damien Regad](https://github.com/dregad) decided to take over the plugin's maintenance.

Thanks to [all the people who contributed](https://github.com/dregad/dokuwiki-plugin-addnewpage/graphs/contributors) to this plugin over the years.
